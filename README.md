🌐 Discord Token Security Analyzer
🛡️ Educational & Authorized Lab Use Only
📘 Overview

Discord Token Security Analyzer is an educational tool designed to demonstrate how Discord tokens are structured, stored, and protected, without interacting with real user data.

This repository is intended for:

🧪 Cybersecurity labs

🎓 Educational environments

🔍 Malware analysis training

🛠️ Secure coding practice

🕵️ Digital forensics demonstrations

⚠️ No real tokens are collected, extracted, or transmitted.
All operations use simulated / mock data.

✨ Features
🔐 Token Structure Analysis

Shows how Discord tokens are formatted and why improper storage is dangerous.

📁 Secure Local Storage Demo

Simulates how applications safely (and unsafely) store credential-like data.

🔍 Detection Training

Includes examples of patterns used by malicious scripts—without using harmful code.

🧰 Developer Learning Tools

Great for understanding:

How token authentication works

Why local storage must be protected

How to identify suspicious scripts

How to harden your own applications

🚀 Getting Started
📌 Requirements

Python 3.10+


This will analyze mock tokens, show how patterns work, and demonstrate detection logic.

🧠 Why This Exists

Many beginners encounter dangerous scripts online disguised as “token grabbers.”
This project teaches how they work internally, so students and analysts can:

Detect malicious code

Understand the risks

Learn secure alternatives

Improve their cybersecurity awareness

This is a safe, controlled, ethical learning environment.

🛡️ Ethical & Legal Notice
